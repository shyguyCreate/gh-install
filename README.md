# Github Release Installer

`gh-install` is a shell script that installs packages from the *Github Releases* section. Either program binaries or fonts can be installed, update and remove in Linux systems with this script.

Only some programs are available for install, refer to the [apps folder](./apps) to see which are available.

Consider contributing to extend the list of available packages. A template for binaries and fonts packages can be found in the [templates folder](./templates).
